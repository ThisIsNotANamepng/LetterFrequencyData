# Letter Frequency Data

This repo has the results of my enhanced letter frequencies, my process and explanation is [here](https://hagen.rip/research/Specific%20Letter%20Frequencies)

The dictionary_letter_frequencies folder has the letter frequencies for a dictionary of words, while letter_frequencies has the frequencies for an adjusted Cornell Movie Corpus (outlined in my website post)

Each folder has 24 csv files, one for each letter length. In each file the frequency for each letter position is separated by another column header. I know its a bad format. 

For example, in 4_letter_long_statistics.csv line 59, you'll find the frequency of the letter 'd' in the third position of four letter words in the [Cornell Movie Dialogues Corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html)
